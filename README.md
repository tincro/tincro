# Thanks for visiting! 

I'm Austin. I'm a 3D artist and self-taught developer.

My favorite language I've learned so far is Python.

I'm currently learning Linux and how powerful and amazing open source is! 

I would love to collaborate on an open source project, I'd even consider starting one if I had the right idea!

I'm interested in networking with like-minded artists or programmers, or someone that would enjoy showing me the ropes of development.

If you have any advice for me, I'm all ears and would love to connect!

My goals are to work in technical space for VFX.
